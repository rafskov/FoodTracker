# FoodTracker
Project 1 from Herbert's UltimateFlaskCourse


#Goals
[]Refresh on Flask
[]Understand process for planning and starting a project
[]Hack it


#Planning
-starts out with HTML and css to layout inputs and styling which go to templates and static folder
-the app creates a log by day, creates a record in each day, creates a food item that can be added to each record...these become routes
-starts from one app.py file and then breaks it out

#verify the routes are working
-ensure styles are being loaded

#setup the db
-creates database in terminal with separate sql script that is passed to sqlite command line
-uses database helpers in main app.py file

#fix form to reference routes

#test form along the way

#grab values from the form and insert them in the /add route
